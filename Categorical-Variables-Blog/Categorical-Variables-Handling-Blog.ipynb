    "Categorical variables are those values which are selected from a group of categories or\n",
    "labels. For example, the variable may be “color” and may take on the values “red,” “green,” and “blue.” Or the variable Gender with the values of male or female is categorical, and so is the variable marital status with the values of never married, married, divorced, or widowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allmost all Machine learning and deep learning neural networks algorithms require that input and output variables are numbers, requiring that categorical data must be encoded to numbers before we can use it to feed to models and evaluate a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few techniques to encode categorical variables for modeling, although the three most common are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integer Encoding: Where each unique label is mapped to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One Hot Encoding: Where each label is mapped to a binary vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learned Embedding: Where a distributed representation of the categories is learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some categorical variables, the labels have an intrinsic order, for example, in the variable Student's grade, the values of A, B, C, or Fail are ordered, A being the highest grade and Fail the lowest. These are called ordinal categorical variables. Variables in which the categories do not have an intrinsic order are called nominal categorical variables, such as the variable City, with the values of London, Manchester, Bristol, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of categorical variables are often encoded as strings. Scikit-learn, does not support strings as values, therefore, we need to transform those strings into numbers. The act of replacing strings with numbers is called categorical encoding."
