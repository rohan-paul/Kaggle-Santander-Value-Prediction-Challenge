    "Gradient Boosted trees have become one of the most powerful algorithms for training on tabular data. Over the recent past, we’ve been fortunate to have may implementations of boosted trees – each with their own unique characteristics.\n",
    "In this notebook, I will implement LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost to tackle this Kaggle problem.\n",

    "**What is  Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. How Boosting Algorithm Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle behind the working of the boosting algorithm is to generate multiple weak learners and combine their predictions to form one strong rule. These weak rules are generated by applying base Machine Learning algorithms on different distributions of the data set. These algorithms generate weak rules for each iteration. After multiple iterations, the weak learners are combined to form a strong learner that will predict a more accurate outcome.\n",
    " Note that a weak learner is one which is slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree whose predictions are slightly better than 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Gradient Boosting** works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weights at every iteration like AdaBoost does, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s how the algorithm works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: The base algorithm reads the data and assigns equal weight to each sample observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: False predictions made by the base learner are identified. In the next iteration, these false predictions are assigned to the next base learner with a higher weightage on these incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Repeat step 2 until the algorithm can correctly classify the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the main aim of Boosting is to focus more on miss-classified predictions.\n",
    "\n",

    "[Source](https://catboost.ai/news/catboost-enables-fast-gradient-boosting-on-decision-trees-using-gpus)\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are used to build ensemble models in an iterative way. On the first iteration, the algorithm learns the first tree to reduce the training error, shown on left-hand image above. The right-hand image above, shows the second iteration, in which the algorithm learns one more tree to reduce the error made by the first tree. The algorithm repeats this procedure until it builds a decent quality mode.\n",

    "The common approach for classification uses Logloss while regression optimizes using root mean square error. Ranking tasks commonly implements some variation of LambdaRank."

    "`df.columns.duplicated()` returns a boolean array: a `True` or `False` for each column. If it is `False` then the column name is unique up to that point, if it is `True` then the column name is duplicated earlier. For example, using the given example, the returned value would be `[False,False,True]`. \n",

    "`Pandas` allows one to index using boolean values whereby it selects only the `True` values. Since we want to keep the unduplicated columns, we need the above boolean array to be flipped (ie `[True, True, False] = ~[False,False,True]`)\n",

    "**What is Sparse data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say that we are collecting data from a device which has 12 sensors. And you have collected data for 10 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you have collected is as follows:\n",
    "[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is an example of sparse data because most of the sensor outputs are zero. Which means those sensors are functioning properly but the actual reading is zero. Although this matrix has high dimensional data (12 axises) it can be said that it contains less information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, sparse data means that there are many gaps present in the data being recorded. For example, in the case of the sensor mentioned above, the sensor may send a signal only when the state changes, like when there is a movement of the door in a room. This data will be obtained intermittently because the door is not always moving. Hence, this is sparse data.\n",

    "## LightGBM Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamentals of LightGBM Model\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a **gradient boosting** model that makes use of tree based learning algorithms. It is considered to be a fast processing algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "While other algorithms trees grow horizontally, LightGBM algorithm grows vertically, meaning it grows leaf-wise and other algorithms grow level-wise. LightGBM chooses the leaf with large loss to grow. It can lower down more loss than a level wise algorithm when growing the same leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/pzOP2Lb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source of Image](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/which-algorithm-takes-the-crown-light-gbm-vs-xgboost/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Light GBM is prefixed as Light because of its high speed. Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why Light GBM is so popular is because it focuses on accuracy of results. LGBM also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists are widely using LGBM for data science application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leaf growth technique in LightGBM**\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM uses leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth. It chooses to grow the leaf that minimizes the loss, allowing a growth of an imbalanced tree. Because it doesn’t grow level-wise, but leaf-wise, over-fitting can happen when data is small. In these cases, it is important to control the tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use LightGBM ?\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM is not preferred for a small volume of datasets as it can easily overfit small data due to its sensitivity. Hence, it generally advised for data having more than 10,000+ rows, though there is no fixed threshold that helps in deciding the usage of LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are LightGBM Parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "While, LightGBM has more than 100 parameters that are given in the [documentation of LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), let's checkout the most important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max depth**: It gives the depth of the tree and also controls the overfitting of the model. If you feel your model is getting overfitted lower down the max depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min_data_in_leaf**: Leaf minimum number of records also used for controlling overfitting of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature_fraction**: It decides the randomly chosen parameter in every iteration for building trees. If it is 0.7 then it means 70% of the parameter would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging_fraction**: It checks for the data fraction that will be used in every iteration. Often, used to increase the training speed and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early_stopping_round**: If the metric of the validation data does show any improvement in last early_stopping_round rounds. It will lower the imprudent iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lambda**: It states regularization. Its values range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min_gain_to_split**: Used to control the number of splits in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: It tells about the task that is to be performed on the data. It can either train on the data or prediction on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application**: This parameter specifies whether to do regression or classification. LightGBM default parameter for application is regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary**: It is used for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiclass**: It is used for multiclass classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression**: It is used for doing regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting**: It specifies the algorithm type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rf** :  Used for Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goss**: Gradient-based One Side Sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Num_boost_round**: It tells about the boosting iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning_rate**: The role of learning rate is to power the magnitude of the changes in the approximate that gets updated from each tree’s output. It has values : 0.1,0.001,0.003.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Num_leaves**: It gives the total number of leaves that would be present in a full tree, default value: 31\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes care of the loss while building the model. Some of them are stated below for classification as well as regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mae**: Mean absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mse**: Mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary_logloss**: Binary Classification loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi_logloss**: Multi Classification loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Tuning is an important part that is usually done by data scientists to achieve a good accuracy, fast result and to deal with overfitting. Let us see quickly some of the parameter tuning you can do for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**num_leaves**: This parameter is responsible for the complexity of the model. Its values should be ideally less than or equal to 2. If its value is more it would result in overfitting of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min_data_in_leaf**: Assigning bigger value to this parameter can result in underfitting of the model. Giving it a value of 100 or 1000 is sufficient for a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max_depth**: To limit the depth of the tree max_depth is used."

Developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, it is the successor of the MatrixNet algorithm that is widely used within the company for ranking tasks, forecasting and making recommendations. It is universal and can be applied across a wide range of areas and to a variety of problems.\"\n",

    "Categorical features have a discrete set of values called categories which are not necessary comparable with each other; thus, such features cannot be used in binary decision trees directly. A common practice for dealing with categorical features is converting them to numbers at the preprocessing time, i.e., each category for each example is substituted with one or several numerical values. The most widely used technique which is usually applied to low-cardinality categorical features is one-hot encoding: the original feature is removed and a new binary variable is added for each category [14]. One-hot encoding can be done during the preprocessing phase or during training, the latter can be implemented more efficiently in terms of training time and is implemented in CatBoost.\n",

    "## CatBoost Training Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the common parameters in CatBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "**loss_function** alias as **objective** — Metric used for training. These are regression metrics such as root mean squared error for regression and logloss for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**eval_metric** — Metric used for detecting over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iterations** — The maximum number of trees to be built, defaults to 1000. It aliases are num_boost_round, n_estimators, and num_trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**learning_rate** alias **eta** — The learning rate that determines how fast or slow the model will learn. The default is usually varies between 0.01 to 0.03.\n",
    "\n",
    "**random_seed** alias **random_state** — The random seed used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**l2_leaf_reg** alias **reg_lambda** — Coefficient at the L2 regularization term of the cost function. The default is 3.0.\n",
    "bootstrap_type — Determines the sampling method for the weights of the objects, e.g Bayesian, Bernoulli, MVS, and Poisson.\n",
    "depth —The depth of the tree.\n",
    "grow_policy — Determines how the greedy search algorithm will be applied. It can be either SymmetricTree, Depthwise, or Lossguide. SymmetricTree is the default. In SymmetricTree, the tree is built level-by-level until the depth is attained. In every step, leaves from the previous tree are split with the same condition. When Depthwise is chosen, a tree is built step-by-step until the specified depth is achieved. On each step, all non-terminal leaves from the last tree level are split. The leaves are split using the condition that leads to the best loss improvement. In Lossguide, the tree is built leaf-by-leaf until the specified number of leaves is attained. On each step, the non-terminal leaf with the best loss improvement is split\n",
    "min_data_in_leaf alias min_child_samples — This is the minimum number of training samples in a leaf. This parameter is only used with the Lossguide and Depthwise growing policies.\n",
    "max_leaves alias num_leaves — This parameter is used only with the Lossguide policy and determines the number of leaves in the tree.\n",
    "ignored_features — Indicates the features that should be ignored in the training process.\n",
    "nan_mode — The method for dealing with missing values. The options are Forbidden, Min, and Max. The default is Min. When Forbidden is used, the presence of missing values leads to errors. With Min, the missing values are taken as the minimum values for that feature. In Max, the missing values are treated as the maximum value for the feature.\n",
    "leaf_estimation_method — The method used to calculate values in leaves. In classification, 10 Newton iterations are used. Regression problems using quantile or MAE loss use one Exact iteration. Multi classification uses one Netwon iteration.\n",
    "leaf_estimation_backtracking — The type of backtracking to be used during gradient descent. The default is AnyImprovement. AnyImprovement decreases the descent step, up to where the loss function value is smaller than it was in the last iteration. Armijo reduces the descent step until the Armijo condition is met.\n",
    "boosting_type — The boosting scheme. It can be plain for the classic gradient boosting scheme, or ordered, which offers better quality on smaller datasets.\n",
    "score_function — The score type used to select the next split during tree construction. Cosine is the default option. The other available options are L2, NewtonL2, and NewtonCosine.\n",
    "early_stopping_rounds — When True, sets the overfitting detector type to Iter and stops the training when the optimal metric is achieved.\n",
    "classes_count — The number of classes for multi-classification problems.\n",
    "task_type — Whether you are using a CPU or GPU. CPU is the default.\n",
    "devices — The IDs of the GPU devices to be used for training.\n",
    "cat_features — The array with the categorical columns.\n",
    "text_features —Used to declare text columns in classification problems.\n",

    "Normally it is impossible to enumerate all the possible tree structures q. A greedy algorithm that starts from a single leaf and iteratively adds branches to the tree is used instead.
